## Main branch is 1.20.1, you can change branches to get 1.20.4 version


Loader 
-------

Set the position where you want it to walk TOWARDS to load your pearl using *stashmover walkpos
Set the ign of the other account where you're using mover mode. 
Also quick note, enable the stashmover in the position where you want it to walk back to, so like, you enable it at the stash, it sets your position there, walks to load pearl, and goes back to that pos.

Mover
--------

you start at the place where you're moving TO (so where empty dubs are)

build a spiral tower that goes up to throw a pearl off of it

set your pitch and yaw in the stashmover settings (you can check what you need using rotationlock, it will use that pitch and yaw to throw pearl) (make sure that it's not in the same direction as the chest so it doesn't get stuck on it cause it just goes forward to drop down and die)

set chest with the pearls using *stashmover pearlchest (i recommend putting the chest on a spiral tower that goes up cause you're gonna be throwing a pearl off of it anyways)

set the chest you want to put your items into *usingstashmover lootchest

set the position of where it should go to set pearl using *stashmover walkpos (at the top of the spiral)

set the ign of the loader acc in the gui



Setup
-------

On the place where you're moving stuff from, you hopper everything to 1 chest and place a bed right next to it. (I made it get the closest chest to you).

On the place where you're moving it TO, you also hopper everything from 1 chest to everywhere else (the lootchest).

Make a spiral where you're going to throw your pearl off of and also kill yourself by jumping off, so make sure you don't have water down there.
